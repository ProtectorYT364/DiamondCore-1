 * This is the main package where events are handled

 * For example, when one player on Pocket Edition chats, the Pocket Packet
 * Handler will throw a player chat event, and set the Event sender to PocketPlayer,
 * Then in here, where the event is handled, it sends the packets for everyone on Desktop,
 * and everyone on PE

Pocket Minecraft Protocol
==================

Data Formats
------------

Before we start talking about the actual protocol, we must list each data type and how they are written/readen.

Data Type | Description
--------- | -----------
Byte      | Single byte consiting of 8 bits. This has a range of -127 to 127 signed, or 0 to 255 unsigned.
Short     | An integer consisting of two bytes. Has a range of -32,768 to 32,767 signed, or 65,535 unsigned.


Packets
------------
Each packet in Pocket Minecraft has a packet with the format of the ID and the packet itself.
There are also CustomPackets, InternalPackets, which we will get to later.
